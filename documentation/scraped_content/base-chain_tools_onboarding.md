​Crossmint
Crossmint is an enterprise-grade web3 development platform that lets you deploy smart contracts, create email wallets, enable credit-card and cross chain payments, and use APIs to create, distribute, sell, store, and edit NFTs. By abstracting away the core complexities of the Blockchain, Crossmint allows you to build NFT applications without requiring any blockchain experience or holding cryptocurrency, and making the blockchain invisible to end users. Crossmint enables you to provide a Web2 experience for your Web3 apps and onboard users.
​Dynamic
Dynamic is a login platform designed for seamless user onboarding. It offers smart and simple login flows for both crypto-native and non-native users. Dynamic features support for non-custodial embedded wallets and consolidating multiple wallets under a single user account. The Dynamic platform is compatible with most EVM chains, including Base.
​Openfort
Openfort is an infrastructure provider designed to simplify the development of games and gamified experiences across their suite of API endpoints. Authenticated users can instantly access the embedded, non-custodial smart account natively in the game and sign blockchain transactions with one button. The Openfort platform is compatible with most EVM chains, including Base.
Use Auth Guide to allow several onboarding methods into your game regardless of the platform.
​MetaMask Embedded Wallets
MetaMask Embedded Wallets (formerly Web3Auth), brings instant, secure, & seamless OAuth-based and Web3 Native onboarding to Base. Users can log in with Google or Apple and get a non-custodial wallet instantly connected to the network — with no setup or seed phrase required. Setup is entirely handled in the MetaMask (Web3Auth) Dashboard — developers just enable Base, and it works out of the box.

​Privy
Privy is a library designed for progressive user onboarding and authentication. It enables users to connect to your app using traditional methods such as email addresses, phone numbers, or social profiles, as well as through web3 methods like crypto wallets. Additionally, Privy supports embedded wallets, eliminating the need for users to have a self-custodial wallet prior to exploring your app. Privy is compatible with most EVM chains, including Base.
You can get started with Privy here, and check out these starter repos for building a Progressive Web App (PWA) on Base and using the Base Paymaster with Privy.
​Particle Network
