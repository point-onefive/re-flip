It enables builders to:\n\nFocus on solving real user problems\nScale apps globally by default\nOnboard users with a click\nAccept payments from anyone, easily\n\nIt’s fast, cheap, and permissionless, meaning anyone can build and use applications on Base.\nBase has become the hub for innovative use cases in media, entertainment, social, and even artificial intelligence. Clanker, an autonomous AI agent on Base, generated more than $13 million in revenue within three months of its inception. As a cultivator of innovation, Base enables developers to focus on improving their products while retaining more of the upside they generate.\nTraditional app distribution models often require developers to sacrifice 30% of their revenue to app marketplaces. These platforms may incentivize predatory practices—selling user data or requiring personal information—and can restrict or deny access at their discretion. For instance, someone in Nairobi might be unable to use many U.S.-based fintech services.\nIn contrast, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps—an onchain development sector—like Moonwell allow people anywhere in the world to access financial services directly from their phones. This means someone in Nairobi has the same level of access as someone in the U.S., opening opportunities that were previously inaccessible.\n​Expansive developer tools\nDevelopers choose Base for its:\n\nAlways-on global payment rail operating at internet speed\nLow transaction costs (often less than a cent)\nRobust developer tooling\n\nBut there’s more: Base apps can be launched in hours, not days or weeks, thanks to an extensive suite of tools—many of which are open source. We’re reviving the spirit of innovation where two builders in a garage can create a massively successful business.\nSome of the tooling that makes this possible:\n\nBase Account: Onboard your users quickly and securely. Users never have to worry about seed phrases again.\nCoinbase Developer Platform: Access specialized developer services for onchain development, such as free node software, sponsored transactions, and other tools to help you fine-tune your application.\nOnchainKit: A React component library (TypeScript) to help you build apps faster.\nBasenames: More than just human-readable text to replace an address—Basenames are the front page to a builder’s onchain profile.\nVerifications: Enable unique experiences for users with verified credentials.\n\n​Builder support\nMore apps mean more compelling reasons for everyone to get onchain. Base is committed to expanding its developer and user community by creating opportunities for apps to go viral. To support this, Base actively distributes apps through its official channels, including Wallet, X, and Farcaster.\nBeyond growth, Base is also a place to earn. Since its launch, we have dedicated a portion of our revenue to the Optimism Collective, supporting initiatives like Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) and other ecosystem projects.\nWe have also distributed builder grants to more than 1,000 builders. Here are a few ways you can earn on Base:\n\nBuilder Grants: Small, retroactive grants up to 2 ETH\n/base-builds: Weekly grants by rounds to Farcaster builders\nOptimism RPGF: Projects built on Base are eligible for Optimism RPGF\nOther community-driven collaborations through based.management, Bountycaster, and Talent Protocol\n\nBase offers builders access to a high-growth, high-signal community across multiple social platforms, including a Discord server with over 400,000 members, X, and Farcaster. We actively amplify impactful projects on these platforms, helping the community discover new innovations. We believe the developers behind these applications are the key to unlocking an onchain future for everyone.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsRaise issueDeploy on BaseNext⌘I",
