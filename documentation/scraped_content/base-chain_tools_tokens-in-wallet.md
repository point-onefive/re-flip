This page is intended for developers that will or have recently deployed ERC-20 token contracts on Base Mainnet and would like their token details to display as quickly as possible on Coinbase Wallet.
Coinbase Wallet makes any ERC-20 token instantly available for swapping seconds from when the contract is deployed.
Follow the instructions below to ensure your token logo, asset name, and other metadata also appear on Coinbase Wallet.
DisclaimerBase does not endorse any specific token that is deployed on mainnet and made available for swapping.

​Adding your token to the list
The steps below explain how to have your token display quickly on Coinbase Wallet. These instructions work not only for Base, but for any EVM chain supported by Coinbase Wallet (Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, BNB).
​Step 1: Deploy your ERC-20 Token on Base Mainnet
Write and deploy a compliant ERC-20 token smart contract. Test it and then deploy on Base Mainnet. If you’re not a developer, you can use available token launcher tools in the Base ecosystem.
​Step 2: Prepare your metadata and asset images
Prepare a high-resolution image of your token’s logo. Ensure it is clear, identifiable, and representative of your token.
​Step 3: List your cryptocurrency on a listing aggregator
You can list for free on CoinGecko following these instructions
You can pay to be listed on CoinMarketCap following these instructions.
Remember, once your ERC-20 contract is deployed, your asset will immediately be available for native swapping in Coinbase Wallet.
However, you’ll still need to list your token on Birdeye, CoinGecko, or CoinMarketCap for the asset’s logo and other metadata to flow into Coinbase Wallet and be seen by users. It can take 24-48 hours for metadata changes to update.
​Why does my token display in the “Newer tokens” section in the swap flow?
Tokens that are newly launched and haven’t had significant trading volume appear in the newer token section. Once your token reaches a market cap of at least $1M it will no longer be displayed in this section.
DisclaimerNew assets with low liquidity may result in failed swaps or may result in a user receiving less of the destination token due to slippage. An important responsibility of the token creator is to communicate to the community these risks.
​How can I update my token logo or description?
ERC20 metadata can be updated quickly and easily by navigating to the asset’s page on the Coinbase Wallet desktop site (wallet.coinbase.com). Note that any changes you make there will be reflected on Coinbase Wallet only (desktop and mobile).
Step 1: Search for your token on wallet.coinbase.com
Step 2: Scroll to the bottom and click “Update here”
Step 3: Select your logo image or enter the description you want to show
Step 4: Choose the address you want to submit with and click submit
Step 5: Submissions will be reviewed within 5 business days. To expedite approval, we recommend taking the following steps:

Make a post from your official X or Farcaster account documenting the change. The Coinbase Wallet team may reach out to you if they have questions.

Submit the change with the same deployed address that the token contract was deployed with.

If the above guidance doesn’t resolve your issue, please submit more information using this Deform.
​Sharing your token
​Custom trading links
By sharing a unique link to your token’s asset page, your community can easily and safely get your token.
How to get your custom link:
Step 1: Grab your custom link for your token by navigating to the asset page on Coinbase Wallet
Step 2: Click the share button

Step 4: Share it with your community – either by posting it as an official link on your social accounts or as a CTA on your website.
​Trending Swaps on Base
The Trending Swaps on Base module reflects the top tokens traded through the Coinbase Wallet mobile app, browser extension, and website app over the past 24 hours.
By encouraging your community to use Coinbase Wallet, your token can appear on Trending Swaps and reach a wider audience.
​Send via text
With send via text, you can send crypto as easily as sending a text. The crypto you want to send will be retrievable using a claim link, and the link can be shared over text, Twitter, Farcaster, Telegram – anywhere.
Recipients will be prompted to make a Coinbase Wallet to claim the crypto. Whether you’re onboarding people to crypto or looking to easily reward your community, send via text has you covered.
How to send crypto via text:
Step 1: Go to the Send flow in Coinbase Wallet
Step 2: Enter the amount you want to send

Step 4: Enter the amount and type of crypto you wish to send, and click “Create”Copy the link
